Subject: AccuNode AWS Deployment - User Setup Required

Hi [Admin Name],

I need AWS access to deploy our AccuNode application (financial risk assessment platform). 

## Quick Setup Request

**Create User**: `accunode-deployer` (or `pranit-accunode`)
**Access Type**: Programmatic access + Console access (optional)
**Permissions**: PowerUserAccess (AWS managed policy) - covers all needed services

**OR** individually attach these policies:
- AmazonEC2FullAccess
- AmazonRDSFullAccess  
- AmazonVPCFullAccess
- ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess
- AutoScalingFullAccess
- CloudWatchFullAccess
- AmazonSSMFullAccess
- IAMFullAccess (for service roles)

## What I Need Back

Please provide:
1. **AWS Access Key ID** (starts with AKIA...)
2. **AWS Secret Access Key** (long random string)
3. **Confirmation** that user has required permissions

## Project Details

**Application**: AccuNode - Multi-tenant FastAPI platform
**Monthly Cost**: $119-300 (scales with usage)
**Deployment Time**: 2.5 hours same-day
**Services Used**: EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, Redis, Load Balancer, VPC

## Budget Setup (Optional)
- Set budget alert at $150/month
- Email notifications at 80%, 100%, 120% thresholds

## Security Features
- All resources in private VPC
- Database in private subnets only
- Encrypted data at rest and transit
- Proper IAM roles and security groups

## Complete Documentation
I've attached a detailed setup guide (AWS_ADMIN_USER_SETUP.md) with:
- Exact permission requirements
- Cost breakdown by service
- Security configurations
- Resource naming conventions
- Rollback procedures

## Timeline
Once I receive the credentials:
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure setup (30 min, $0 cost)
- **Phase 2**: Database deployment (25 min, $25/month)  
- **Phase 3**: Application deployment (45 min, $89/month)
- **Phase 4**: Production configuration (30 min, $0 additional)
- **Phase 5**: Monitoring setup (20 min, $5/month)

**Total**: 2.5 hours, $119/month starting cost

Ready to begin deployment as soon as you provide the access credentials.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
