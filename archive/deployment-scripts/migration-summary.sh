echo -e "\n🔒 Mixed Content Issue Solutions"
echo "==============================="
echo "❌ Problem: HTTPS frontend → HTTP backend = blocked by browser"
echo "✅ CORS Updated: Now includes http://localhost:3000 for development"
echo ""
echo "📋 Immediate Solutions:"
echo "1. 🖥️  LOCAL TESTING: Use http://localhost:3000 (frontend) → http://ALB (backend)"
echo "2. 🔧 DEVELOPMENT: Test API endpoints directly with tools like Postman"
echo "3. 🎯 PRODUCTION: Set up custom domain with SSL (api.accunode.ai)"
echo ""
echo "🌐 Current Endpoints:"
echo "==================="
echo "Backend API (HTTP):  http://AccuNode-ECS-ALB-761974571.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
echo "Health Check:        http://AccuNode-ECS-ALB-761974571.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health"
echo ""
echo "Frontend Environments:"
echo "• http://localhost:3000           → ✅ Will work (HTTP → HTTP)"  
echo "• https://client-eta-sepia.vercel.app → ❌ Blocked (HTTPS → HTTP)"
echo "• https://accunode.ai             → ❌ Blocked (HTTPS → HTTP)"
echo ""
echo "💡 Next Steps for Production:"
echo "============================"
echo "1. Set up custom domain: api.accunode.ai"
echo "2. Enable SSL certificate on load balancer" 
echo "3. Update production frontend to use: https://api.accunode.ai"
echo ""
echo "🧹 Cleanup Completed:"
echo "===================="
echo "✅ Old EC2 instances terminated (2 instances)"
echo "✅ Auto Scaling Groups deleted (AccuNode-API-ASG, AccuNode-Worker-ASG)" 
echo "✅ Launch Templates removed (AccuNode-API-Template, AccuNode-Worker-Template)"
echo "💰 Monthly savings: ~$100-200 (no more EC2 charges)"
echo ""
echo "🏆 Migration Success Summary:"
echo "============================"
echo "✅ Migrated from EC2 Auto Scaling Groups to ECS Fargate"
echo "✅ API & Worker services running with auto scaling"  
echo "✅ Database and Redis connectivity working"
echo "✅ Load balancer routing traffic correctly"
echo "✅ Old infrastructure cleaned up"
echo "✅ CORS configured for development testing"
echo ""
echo "⚠️  Final Step Needed: HTTPS Setup"
echo "================================="
echo "The mixed content issue will be resolved once HTTPS is enabled."
echo "For immediate testing, use localhost:3000 frontend environment."
