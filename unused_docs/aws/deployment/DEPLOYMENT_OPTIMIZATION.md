# AccuNode Deployment Optimization Strategies
# Solving the 500MB Docker rebuild problem

## Current Problem:
- 500MB Docker image
- 4-5 minutes build + push time
- Full rebuild for small changes
- Manual EC2 updates

## ðŸš€ Solution 1: Multi-Stage Docker Build with Caching

### Optimized Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Use multi-stage build to reduce final image size
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements first (for better caching)
COPY requirements*.txt ./
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.prod.txt

# Production stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as production

# Copy only installed packages from builder
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local

# Copy application code
COPY app/ ./app/
COPY main.py start.sh ./

# Make sure scripts are executable
RUN chmod +x start.sh

# Set PATH
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH

CMD ["./start.sh"]
```

## ðŸš€ Solution 2: Layer-Optimized Build Strategy

### Build script with smart caching
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only rebuild changed layers

# 1. Base image (rarely changes)
docker build --target base --cache-from accunode:base -t accunode:base .

# 2. Dependencies layer (changes when requirements change)
docker build --target deps --cache-from accunode:base,accunode:deps -t accunode:deps .

# 3. Application layer (changes frequently)
docker build --cache-from accunode:base,accunode:deps,accunode:latest -t accunode:latest .
```

## ðŸš€ Solution 3: GitOps with GitHub Actions (Recommended)

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- Push code to GitHub
- GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically
- Only changed layers rebuild
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Rollback capability

## ðŸš€ Solution 4: Code Deployment without Docker Rebuild

### Hot deployment strategy:
1. Keep the same base Docker image
2. Mount code as volume or use git pull inside container
3. Restart application process (not container)
4. 30-second deployments instead of 5 minutes

## ðŸ“Š Comparison:

| Method | Deploy Time | Complexity | Reliability | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|------|
| Current | 5 minutes | Low | Medium | High |
| Multi-stage | 2-3 minutes | Medium | High | Medium |
| Layer Cache | 1-2 minutes | Medium | High | Medium |
| GitOps | 2-3 minutes | High | Very High | Low |
| Hot Deploy | 30 seconds | Low | Medium | Very Low |

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation:
Start with **Hot Deploy** for development, then implement **GitOps** for production.
