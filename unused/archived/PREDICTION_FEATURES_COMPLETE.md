COMPLETE PREDICTION API FEATURES SUMMARY
=========================================

This document summarizes all the prediction API features that have been added
to provide a complete enterprise-grade financial risk prediction system.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
====================

1. CRUD OPERATIONS FOR PREDICTIONS
   - ✅ Create annual predictions (POST /api/v1/predictions/annual)
   - ✅ Create quarterly predictions (POST /api/v1/predictions/quarterly) 
   - ✅ Read/List annual predictions with pagination (GET /api/v1/predictions/annual)
   - ✅ Read/List quarterly predictions with pagination (GET /api/v1/predictions/quarterly)
   - ✅ Update annual predictions (PUT /api/v1/predictions/annual/{prediction_id})
   - ✅ Update quarterly predictions (PUT /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/{prediction_id})
   - ✅ Delete annual predictions (DELETE /api/v1/predictions/annual/{prediction_id})
   - ✅ Delete quarterly predictions (DELETE /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/{prediction_id})

2. BULK UPLOAD SYSTEMS
   - ✅ Synchronous bulk upload (POST /api/v1/predictions/bulk-upload)
   - ✅ Async bulk upload for annual predictions (POST /api/v1/predictions/annual/bulk-upload-async)
   - ✅ Async bulk upload for quarterly predictions (POST /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/bulk-upload-async)
   - ✅ Job status tracking (GET /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}/status)
   - ✅ List all jobs (GET /api/v1/predictions/jobs)

3. JOB TRACKING & MONITORING
   - ✅ Background job processing with real-time status updates
   - ✅ Progress tracking (processed/successful/failed rows)
   - ✅ Error logging and detailed error reporting
   - ✅ File validation and safety limits (max 10,000 rows)
   - ✅ Support for CSV and Excel files
   - ✅ Organization-scoped job management

4. ENTERPRISE FEATURES
   - ✅ Multi-tenant organization scoping
   - ✅ Role-based access control (5-role hierarchy)
   - ✅ Scoped company creation (same symbol allowed across organizations)
   - ✅ Global data access control (organization-level setting)
   - ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
   - ✅ Automatic ML model integration

ROLE-BASED PERMISSIONS:
======================

CREATE PREDICTIONS:     org_member and above
UPDATE PREDICTIONS:     org_member and above  
DELETE PREDICTIONS:     org_admin and above
BULK UPLOAD:           org_member and above (async), org_admin and above (sync)
VIEW JOB STATUS:       org_member and above

ASYNC BULK UPLOAD WORKFLOW:
===========================

1. User uploads CSV/Excel file → File validation
2. System creates job record → Returns job_id
3. Background task processes data → Updates job status
4. User monitors progress → GET /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}/status
5. Job completes → Results available in job status

JOB STATUS FIELDS:
=================

- id: Job UUID
- status: pending | processing | completed | failed
- job_type: annual | quarterly
- original_filename: Uploaded file name
- total_rows: Total rows in file
- processed_rows: Rows processed so far
- successful_rows: Successfully processed rows
- failed_rows: Failed rows
- progress_percentage: Completion percentage
- error_message: General error message (if failed)
- error_details: Detailed errors for specific rows
- timestamps: created_at, started_at, completed_at

DATABASE CHANGES:
================

✅ Added BulkUploadJob table with proper indexing
✅ Organization-scoped data access controls
✅ Scoped company constraints (symbol + organization_id unique)
✅ Job tracking with progress and error logging

NEXT STEPS FOR POSTMAN COLLECTION:
==================================

1. Add UPDATE endpoints:
   - PUT /api/v1/predictions/annual/{prediction_id}
   - PUT /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/{prediction_id}

2. Add DELETE endpoints:
   - DELETE /api/v1/predictions/annual/{prediction_id}
   - DELETE /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/{prediction_id}

3. Add ASYNC BULK UPLOAD endpoints:
   - POST /api/v1/predictions/annual/bulk-upload-async
   - POST /api/v1/predictions/quarterly/bulk-upload-async

4. Add JOB TRACKING endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}/status
   - GET /api/v1/predictions/jobs

5. Add test data and examples for:
   - CSV file upload samples
   - Job status polling examples
   - Error handling scenarios

COMPANY ENDPOINTS DECISION:
==========================

RECOMMENDATION: Keep simplified company endpoints for:
- Browse/search existing companies across organizations
- Company analytics and reporting
- Data exploration and validation

REASONING:
- Predictions auto-create companies (core workflow)
- But users may want to browse existing companies
- Useful for data validation and preventing duplicates
- Analytics and reporting on company data

SIMPLIFIED COMPANY API:
- GET /api/v1/companies/ (list with filters)
- GET /api/v1/companies/{company_id} (read single)
- Remove POST/PUT/DELETE (predictions handle creation/updates)

This provides a complete enterprise-grade prediction system with:
✅ Full CRUD operations
✅ Async bulk processing
✅ Job tracking and monitoring  
✅ Multi-tenant security
✅ Professional error handling
✅ Comprehensive validation
