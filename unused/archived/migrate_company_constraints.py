Database Migration: Fix Company Symbol Constraints
=================================================

This script migrates the database to allow scoped company creation:
1. Drops the old unique constraint on symbol
2. Adds a new composite unique constraint on (symbol, organization_id)

This allows multiple organizations to have companies with the same symbol.
