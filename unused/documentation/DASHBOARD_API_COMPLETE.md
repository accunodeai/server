| `super_admin` | system | All system predictions |

---

## Recent Updates

### ‚úÖ Added to User Dashboard
- `annual_predictions`: Count of annual predictions in user's scope
- `quarterly_predictions`: Count of quarterly predictions in user's scope
- Better prediction type breakdown for analytics

### ‚ùå Removed from Platform Statistics  
- `total_users`: No longer returned (privacy/security)
- `total_organizations`: No longer returned (internal metric)
- `total_tenants`: No longer returned (internal metric)

### üîÑ Enhanced Data Structure

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dashboard Request
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/dashboard"
```

### Dashboard with Platform Statistics
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"include_platform_stats": true}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/dashboard"
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/predictions/dashboard', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        include_platform_stats: true
    })
});

const dashboardData = await response.json();

// Access prediction breakdown
const userAnnual = dashboardData.user_dashboard.annual_predictions;
const userQuarterly = dashboardData.user_dashboard.quarterly_predictions;
const userTotal = dashboardData.user_dashboard.total_predictions;

// Verify: userAnnual + userQuarterly should equal userTotal
console.assert(userAnnual + userQuarterly === userTotal);
```

## Integration Notes

### Frontend Integration
- Use `annual_predictions` and `quarterly_predictions` for charts and analytics
- `platform_statistics` provides system-wide context when needed
- `scope` field helps UI determine what data visualization to show

### Data Validation
- Always verify: `annual_predictions + quarterly_predictions = total_predictions`
- Check `scope` field to understand data context
- Handle cases where `platform_statistics` might be null (when not requested)

### Performance Considerations
- Set `include_platform_stats: false` if platform data isn't needed
- Dashboard data is computed in real-time, consider caching on frontend
- Scope determination happens automatically, no need for additional API calls

## Business Use Cases

1. **Personal Analytics**: Users see their prediction portfolio breakdown
2. **Organization Insights**: Teams analyze their collective prediction data  
3. **Platform Overview**: Admins get system-wide metrics for reporting
4. **Prediction Type Analysis**: Understanding annual vs quarterly prediction trends
5. **Risk Assessment**: High-risk company identification across different scopes
