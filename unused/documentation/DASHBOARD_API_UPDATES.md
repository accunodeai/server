### 2. User Dashboard (Added Predictions Breakdown)

        "data_scope": "Personal data only"
    },

## Functions Updated

### 1. `get_platform_statistics()`
- Removed user/organization counting logic
- Kept prediction statistics and company/sector data
- Cleaner, more focused platform metrics

### 2. `get_system_dashboard()`
- Added `annual_predictions` and `quarterly_predictions` breakdown
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 3. `get_organization_dashboard()` 
- Added `annual_predictions` and `quarterly_predictions` breakdown
- Works for both regular org users and tenant admins

### 4. `get_personal_dashboard()`
- Added `annual_predictions` and `quarterly_predictions` breakdown
- Shows user's personal prediction breakdown

## Benefits

### 1. Cleaner Platform Statistics
- Platform stats now focus on business metrics (companies, predictions, sectors)
- Removed internal system metrics (users, organizations) that aren't relevant for business analytics

### 2. Better Predictions Insights
- Users can now see the breakdown between annual and quarterly predictions
- Helps understand data distribution and prediction types
- Useful for analytics and decision making

### 3. Consistent Data Structure
- Both user_dashboard and platform_statistics now have the same prediction structure
- Makes client-side processing easier and more consistent

## API Endpoint
**POST** `/api/v1/predictions/dashboard`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "include_platform_stats": true
}
```

**Use Cases:**
1. **Dashboard Analytics** - See annual vs quarterly prediction distribution
2. **Data Overview** - Understand prediction types in user's scope  
3. **Platform Metrics** - Get clean business-focused platform statistics
4. **Reporting** - Generate reports with prediction type breakdowns

## Testing
Test with different user roles to verify:
- Personal users see their prediction breakdown
- Organization users see org prediction breakdown  
- System admins see system-wide prediction breakdown
- Platform statistics exclude user/org counts
- Annual + Quarterly = Total predictions (math check)
