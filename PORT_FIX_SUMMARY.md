ðŸŽ¯ PORT VARIABLE FIX SUMMARY
=============================

âœ… PROBLEM SOLVED:
The error "Invalid value for '--port': '${PORT:-8000}' is not a valid integer" was caused by Railway trying to run the uvicorn command directly from railway.toml without proper bash variable expansion.

âœ… SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Created start.sh Script:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   export PORT=${PORT:-8000}
   echo "Starting FastAPI app on port $PORT..."
   exec uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port "$PORT" --workers 1
   ```

2. **Updated railway.toml:**
   ```toml
   [deploy]
   startCommand = "./start.sh"
   healthcheckPath = "/health"
   ```

3. **Updated Dockerfile:**
   - Added `RUN chmod +x start.sh` to make script executable
   - Changed CMD to `["./start.sh"]`

âœ… HOW IT WORKS:
- Railway runs `./start.sh` instead of uvicorn directly  
- Bash script properly expands `${PORT:-8000}` variable
- If Railway sets PORT, it uses that value
- If PORT is not set, it defaults to 8000
- Script passes the actual integer value to uvicorn

âœ… TESTED & VERIFIED:
- âœ… Docker builds successfully
- âœ… Container starts with proper port handling
- âœ… FastAPI app loads with ML models
- âœ… Port variable expansion works correctly

ðŸš€ READY TO DEPLOY:
Your Railway deployment should now work without the port variable error!

Commands to deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix PORT variable handling with start.sh script"
git push
./deploy-railway.sh
```
