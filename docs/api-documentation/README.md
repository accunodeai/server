## ML Prediction Models

AccuNode provides two types of financial risk predictions:

### Annual Predictions
- Model: Logistic Regression with preprocessing
- Ratios: 5 (long_term_debt_to_total_capital, total_debt_to_ebitda, net_income_margin, ebit_to_interest_expense, return_on_assets)
- Output: Risk level + probability + confidence

### Quarterly Predictions
- Model: Ensemble (Logistic Regression + LightGBM)
- Ratios: 4 (total_debt_to_ebitda, sga_margin, long_term_debt_to_total_capital, return_on_capital)
- Output: Ensemble/logistic/gbm probabilities + risk level + confidence

## Organization-Based Access

Access control is organization-scoped. See the primer: `../core-application/access-model.md`.
- Read filters respect personal/organization/system scopes
- Updates to predictions are owner-only (creator can edit)
- Global visibility can be toggled per organization via global-data-access endpoints

## Development & Testing

- Local API: `http://localhost:8000`
- Interactive Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger) and `/redoc`

Quick testing commands
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Open interactive documentation (macOS)
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Integration Examples (curl)

```bash
# Auth: login
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"pass"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login

# List companies
TOKEN="<jwt>"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/companies

# Create annual prediction
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company_id":"<uuid>","reporting_year":"2024","long_term_debt_to_total_capital":0.12,"total_debt_to_ebitda":2.1,"net_income_margin":0.08,"ebit_to_interest_expense":3.2,"return_on_assets":0.05}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/annual
```

## Authentication System

AccuNode uses JWT for secure API access.
- Include: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Default expiry: 60 minutes

Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Level | Can Access |
|------|-------|------------|
| user | 1 | Basic profile only |
| org_member | 2 | Companies, predictions (org scope) |
| org_admin | 3 | + User/whitelist in org |
| tenant_admin | 4 | + Tenant orgs/users |
| super_admin | 5 | Full system access |
