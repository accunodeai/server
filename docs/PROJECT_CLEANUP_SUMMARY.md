# Project Cleanup Summary

## 📁 Clean Project Structure

The project has been cleaned and organized with the following structure:

### Core Application Files ✅
```
├── app/                          # Main application code
├── deployment/                   # Production deployment configs
│   ├── ecs-api-task-definition.json
│   ├── ecs-worker-task-definition.json
│   └── ecs-fargate-infrastructure.yaml
├── data/                        # ML model data files
├── docs/                        # Documentation
├── aws/                         # AWS configuration files
├── Dockerfile                   # Production Docker configuration
├── main.py                      # Application entry point
├── start.sh                     # Production startup script
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

### Files Moved to Archive 📦
All temporary, test, and development files have been moved to `/archive/` folder:

- **Test Files**: `test_quarterly_fix.py`, debug scripts
- **Build Scripts**: `build-docker.sh`, deployment helpers
- **Development Scripts**: All scripts from `/scripts/` folder
- **Deployment Helpers**: Setup and migration scripts
- **Temporary Files**: AWS installer, unused configurations

## 🚀 Ready for CI/CD

The project is now clean and ready for CI/CD pipeline implementation:

### What's Ready:
1. ✅ Clean project structure
2. ✅ Working ECS Fargate deployment
3. ✅ Quarterly processing fix implemented
4. ✅ Production-ready Docker configuration
5. ✅ All test files archived for future reference

### Next Steps:
1. Commit current clean state
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
3. Automate Docker build and ECR push
4. Automate ECS service deployments

## 📋 Files Kept in Main Structure

### Essential Files Only:
- **Application Code**: `/app/` directory
- **Deployment Config**: ECS task definitions and infrastructure
- **Docker Config**: Production Dockerfile
- **Dependencies**: requirements.txt files
- **Documentation**: Core docs and README
- **Data**: ML model files and prediction data

All development and testing artifacts are safely archived for future reference while keeping the main project clean and production-ready.
