## üìã Overview

The **Financial Default Risk Prediction System** is a sophisticated multi-tenant SaaS platform designed for enterprise-level financial risk assessment. The system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict corporate default probability based on financial metrics, providing organizations with crucial insights for credit risk management and investment decisions.

## üåü Key Features

### üöÄ Core Functionality
- **Dual Prediction Models**: Annual and Quarterly default risk predictions
- **Real-time ML Processing**: Advanced ensemble models for accurate risk assessment
- **Bulk Data Processing**: Upload and process thousands of companies simultaneously
- **Multi-format Support**: CSV and Excel file processing with validation
- **Async Job Processing**: Background processing with real-time status updates

### üè¢ Enterprise Architecture
- **Multi-Tenant Design**: Complete isolation between different organizations
- **5-Tier Role System**: Granular access control from super admins to basic users
- **Organization Management**: Sophisticated hierarchy with tenant-organization structure
- **Global Data Sharing**: Configurable cross-organization data access
- **Whitelist Security**: Email-based invitation system for controlled access

### üîí Security & Performance
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Role-based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles
- **Data Isolation**: Organization-scoped data access with optional global sharing
- **Redis Caching**: High-performance caching for ML models and session data
- **Celery Background Jobs**: Scalable async processing for bulk operations
