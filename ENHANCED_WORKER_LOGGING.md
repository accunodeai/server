# 🔧 Enhanced Worker Logging & Resilience Implementation

## 🚀 Worker Startup Enhancements

### Enhanced Startup Script Features

The updated `start-worker.sh` now includes:

#### 📊 **Comprehensive System Logging**
```bash
# Logs include:
- Hostname and container information
- Railway service and environment details
- System resources (memory, CPU cores)
- Python version and worker PID
- Working directory and environment variables
```

#### 🔍 **Pre-flight Health Checks**
```bash
# Validates before starting:
✅ Redis connection with detailed diagnostics
✅ Database connectivity testing
✅ Celery app import and task registration
✅ Queue availability and current task counts
```

#### 🛡️ **Error Resilience Features**
```bash
# Worker won't crash due to:
- Redis connection issues (detailed error reporting)
- Database temporary outages (graceful degradation)
- Import failures (comprehensive error messages)
- Signal handling for graceful shutdowns
```

#### 📈 **Real-time Monitoring**
```bash
# Background health monitor:
- Checks worker process every 5 minutes
- Reports active/reserved task counts
- Logs worker statistics and performance
- Attempts automatic recovery if needed
```

## 📋 Enhanced Task Logging

### TaskLogger Class Features

```python
# Each log entry includes:
[2025-09-25 10:34:25] [INFO] [TASK:process_annual_bulk_upload_task] 
[ID:celery-task-123] [JOB:job-uuid] [USER:user-456] [FILE:predictions.xlsx] 
[ROWS:250/1000] [QUEUE:medium] [RATE:45.2/s] [TIME:5.5s] Processing progress...
```

#### 🎯 **Enhanced Context Tracking**
- **Task ID**: Celery task identifier
- **Job ID**: Bulk upload job UUID
- **User ID**: Who initiated the upload
- **File Name**: Original filename
- **Progress**: Current/total rows processed
- **Queue Priority**: high/medium/low routing
- **Processing Rate**: Rows per second
- **Elapsed Time**: Total processing time

#### 📊 **Progress Reporting**
```python
# Automatic progress logs every 5%:
📈 Processing progress: 25.0% (250/1000 rows)
📈 Processing progress: 50.0% (500/1000 rows) 
📈 Processing progress: 75.0% (750/1000 rows)
📈 Processing progress: 100.0% (1000/1000 rows)
```

#### 🎉 **Success Logging**
```python
# Completion includes detailed statistics:
🎉 Bulk upload completed successfully
   - Success Rate: 98.5% (985/1000 rows)
   - Processing Time: 22.3 seconds
   - Processing Rate: 44.8 rows/second
   - Failed Rows: 15 (with detailed error info)
```

#### ❌ **Enhanced Error Handling**
```python
# Individual row errors:
❌ Row processing failed: Invalid company symbol 'XYZ123'
   - Row Number: 156
   - Company Symbol: XYZ123
   - Error Details: [specific error message]

# Critical task failures:
💥 CRITICAL: Task failed with exception
   - Full stack trace included
   - Processing time before failure
   - Rows processed before crash
   - Recovery recommendations
```

## 🔄 Worker Resilience Features

### 🛡️ **Error Recovery Mechanisms**

#### Database Connection Issues
```python
# Workers continue operating during:
- Temporary database outages
- Connection pool exhaustion  
- Transaction deadlocks
- Network connectivity issues
```

#### Redis/Broker Problems
```python
# Graceful handling of:
- Redis connection drops
- Message broker restarts
- Queue unavailability
- Memory pressure
```

#### Task-Level Failures
```python
# Individual task failures don't crash worker:
- ML model prediction errors
- Data validation failures  
- File parsing issues
- External API timeouts
```

### 🔄 **Automatic Recovery**

#### Worker Health Monitoring
```bash
# Background monitor detects and handles:
- Dead worker processes → Restart attempts
- Memory leaks → Worker recycling
- Stuck tasks → Task termination
- Resource exhaustion → Scaling triggers
```

#### Graceful Shutdown
```bash
# Signal handling for:
SIGTERM → Graceful worker shutdown (30s timeout)
SIGINT  → Immediate cleanup and exit
SIGQUIT → Force termination with cleanup
```
