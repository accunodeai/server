# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Files Created/Updated for Railway + Neon PostgreSQL

### Docker Configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Production-ready container for Railway
- `.dockerignore` - Optimized for cloud deployment
- `.railwayignore` - Railway-specific ignore rules

### Railway Configuration  
- `deployment/railway/railway.toml` - Railway service configuration
- `deployment/railway/nixpacks.toml` - Nixpacks build configuration (Railway's preferred)
- `requirements.prod.txt` - Updated dependencies for Railway + Neon

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-railway.sh` - Automated Railway deployment script
- `setup-neon-db.py` - Database setup script for Neon PostgreSQL

### Documentation
- `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.md` - Complete environment variables guide
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Database setup instructions
- `MONITORING_GUIDE.md` - Production monitoring guide

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project (if not already linked)
railway link
```

### 2. Set Up Neon Database
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your connection string
4. Set in Railway:
```bash
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require"
```

### 3. Deploy Automatically
```bash
# Use the automated deployment script
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### 4. Or Deploy Manually
```bash
# Set essential variables
railway variables set SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
railway variables set JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT="production"
railway variables set DEBUG="false"

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 5. Set Up Database Schema
```bash
# After deployment, run database setup
railway run python setup-neon-db.py
```

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

### API Documentation
```bash
# Open in browser
https://your-app.railway.app/docs
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Update the test script with your URL
./test-railway.sh
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- Monitor logs, metrics, and deployments
- Set up alerts and notifications
- View resource usage

### Health Endpoint
Your app includes a comprehensive health check at `/health` that monitors:
- Database connectivity
- Redis connection (if configured)  
- ML model availability
- System resources

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL in Railway variables
   - Check Neon database is running
   - Ensure SSL mode is enabled

2. **App Won't Start**
   - Check Railway logs: `railway logs --tail`
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check dependencies in requirements.prod.txt

3. **High Memory Usage**
   - Monitor ML model memory usage
   - Consider reducing worker count
   - Check for memory leaks in pandas operations

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# View real-time logs
railway logs --tail

# View specific service logs
railway logs --service your-service-name
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Index frequently queried columns
- Monitor slow queries in Neon dashboard

### Application Optimization
- Enable gzip compression (already configured)
- Use async/await for database operations
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Railway Optimization
- Use Railway's built-in Redis for caching
- Enable automatic scaling
- Monitor resource usage

## üîê Security Checklist
- [x] Strong SECRET_KEY and JWT_SECRET_KEY
- [x] Database SSL connection required
- [x] Non-root Docker user
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Environment variables secured
- [x] No secrets in code/Docker images

## üìà Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: Neon handles scaling automatically
- **App**: Railway provides horizontal scaling options  
- **Files**: Consider using external storage for large uploads
- **Background Tasks**: Use Railway Redis for Celery

**Your app is now ready for production deployment on Railway with Neon PostgreSQL! üéâ**
