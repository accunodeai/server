# System Data Separation - Access Control Update

## Problem Identified
The regular prediction endpoints `/predictions/annual` and `/predictions/quarterly` were incorrectly returning **system-level data** to all users, which was not the intended behavior.

## Root Cause
In the `get_data_access_filter()` function, there was this line:
```python
# System data: everyone can see it
conditions.append(prediction_model.access_level == "system")
```

This meant ANY user calling the regular endpoints would get:
- ✅ Personal data (their own predictions)
- ✅ Organization data (if they belong to an org)
- ❌ System data (should be restricted to dedicated endpoints)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Access Filter Function
Modified `get_data_access_filter()` to accept an `include_system` parameter:

```python
def get_data_access_filter(user: User, prediction_model, include_system: bool = False):
    # System data: only include if explicitly requested
    if include_system:
        conditions.append(prediction_model.access_level == "system")
```

### 2. Updated Regular Endpoints
**Regular endpoints now EXCLUDE system data:**

- `/predictions/annual` → Returns only personal + organization data
- `/predictions/quarterly` → Returns only personal + organization data

```python
# Explicitly exclude system data
access_filter = get_data_access_filter(current_user, AnnualPrediction, include_system=False)
```

### 3. System Endpoints Remain Dedicated
**System endpoints continue to return ONLY system data:**

- `/predictions/annual/system` → Returns only system-level data
- `/predictions/quarterly/system` → Returns only system-level data

## Data Access Matrix

| User Role | Regular Endpoints (/annual, /quarterly) | System Endpoints (/annual/system, /quarterly/system) |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **user** | Personal data only | System data only |
| **org_member** | Personal + Organization data | System data only |
| **org_admin** | Personal + Organization data | System data only |
| **tenant_admin** | Personal + Organization data | System data only |
| **super_admin** | Personal + Organization data | System data only |

## Impact

### Before Changes
- Regular users got mixed data (personal + org + system) → **Privacy/Security Issue**
- System data was accessible through multiple endpoints → **Inconsistent API**

### After Changes  
- Regular users get only relevant data (personal + org) → **Proper Data Isolation**
- System data only available via dedicated endpoints → **Clear API Separation**
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing clients → **No Breaking Changes**

## API Usage

### For Regular Business Operations
```bash
# Get user's own and organization predictions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/annual"
```

### For System-Level Analytics
```bash
# Get system-wide prediction data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/annual/system"
```

## Security Benefits
1. **Data Isolation**: Users no longer accidentally receive system-wide data
2. **Clear Intent**: System data access requires explicit endpoint selection  
3. **Audit Trail**: System data access can be easily monitored via `/system` endpoint logs
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get only the data they need for their context

## Testing Recommendation
Test both endpoint types with different user roles to verify:
1. Regular endpoints return only personal+org data
2. System endpoints return only system data
3. No data leakage between access levels
