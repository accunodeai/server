# 🏢 MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the complete multi-tenant architecture for the Financial Default Prediction Platform. The system supports both small individual clients and large enterprise clients with different organizational structures.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Hierarchy

```
🌐 PLATFORM LEVEL
├── Super Admin (manages entire platform)
└── Tenants (enterprise clients) OR Direct Organizations (small clients)

🏢 TENANT LEVEL (Enterprise Only)
├── Tenant Admin (manages all tenant organizations)
├── Multiple Organizations under tenant
└── Tenant-wide policies and settings

🏪 ORGANIZATION LEVEL
├── Org Admin (manages specific organization)
├── Org Users (work in organization)
├── Organization data and predictions
└── Whitelist-based member management

👤 USER LEVEL
├── Personal account
├── Belongs to one organization
├── Role-based access within organization
└── Complete data isolation
```

## 🎯 Two Deployment Models

### Model A: Small Clients (Direct Organizations)

## 🔄 Complete Application Flow

### Phase 1: Client Onboarding

#### Small Client Onboarding
```
1. Client signs up for service
2. Super Admin creates organization directly
3. Assigns client as organization admin
4. Client sets up team whitelist
5. Client shares join link with team
6. Team members join organization
7. Organization ready for use
```

#### Enterprise Client Onboarding
```
1. Enterprise client (e.g., HDFC) signs contract
2. Super Admin creates HDFC tenant
3. Assigns HDFC IT admin as tenant admin
4. HDFC tenant admin takes control
5. HDFC creates their organizations independently
6. HDFC assigns org admins for each branch
7. Each organization sets up normally
```

### Phase 2: Organization Setup (Same for Both Models)

#### Step 1: Whitelist Creation
```
Organization Admin actions:
├── Add approved member emails to whitelist
│   ├── Individual email addition
│   └── Bulk CSV upload
├── Configure organization settings
├── Set default user role for new joiners
└── Generate organization join link
```

#### Step 2: Team Invitation
```
Admin shares join link:
├── Via email to approved team members
├── Via Slack/Teams channels
├── Via company intranet
├── Via WhatsApp or other messaging
└── Any communication method works
```

### Phase 3: User Registration and Joining

#### Approved User Flow
```
1. User clicks join link: https://app.com/join/ORG-TOKEN
2. User sees "Join [Organization Name]" page
3. User registers with email: john@company.com
4. System validates:
   ├── Check if organization exists and active
   ├── Check if email in organization whitelist
   └── Validate organization capacity
5. If approved:
   ├── User account created
   ├── User automatically joined to organization
   ├── User assigned default role
   └── Welcome message displayed
6. User gains immediate access to organization
```

#### Rejected User Flow
```
1. User clicks join link
2. User sees organization page
3. User registers with non-approved email
4. System validates and finds email not whitelisted
5. User account created but no organization access
6. Clear message: "Email not authorized for [Org Name]"
7. User has personal account but cannot access organization
```

### Phase 4: Daily Operations

#### User Workflow
```
Daily user activities:
├── Login to platform
├── Access organization dashboard
├── View organization-specific data
├── Create financial predictions
├── Collaborate with team members
├── Generate reports and analytics

```

```
User-level access control:

```

### Whitelist-Based Security

#### Join Process Security
```
Multi-layer validation:
├── Valid join token verification

├── Organization capacity verification
├── User email verification required
└── Audit logging of all attempts
```

#### Admin Security Controls
```
Organization admin capabilities:
