# 🔧 Job Deletion Logic Fix

## ❌ **Previous Logic (Too Restrictive)**
```python
# Could only delete completed or failed jobs
if job.status in ["pending", "processing"]:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400, 
        detail="Cannot delete active jobs. Only completed or failed jobs can be deleted."
    )
```

## ✅ **New Logic (Correct)**
```python
# Can delete any job except those currently processing
if job.status == "processing":
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400, 
        detail="Cannot delete job that is currently processing. Please cancel the job first or wait for it to complete."
    )
```

## 📋 **Deletion Rules Updated**

### **✅ Can Delete:**
- `pending` - Job created but not started yet
- `queued` - Job sent to Celery but not processing yet  
- `completed` - Job finished successfully
- `failed` - Job failed or was cancelled

### **❌ Cannot Delete:**
- `processing` - Job is actively running (prevents data corruption)

## 🔄 **Workflow**

### **For Processing Jobs:**
1. **Cancel first**: `POST /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}/cancel`
2. **Then delete**: `DELETE /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}`

### **For Other Jobs:**
1. **Delete directly**: `DELETE /api/v1/predictions/jobs/{job_id}`

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **More Flexible**: Users can clean up pending/queued jobs that haven't started
2. **Safer**: Still protects against deleting actively processing jobs
3. **Better UX**: Clear error message explains how to handle processing jobs
4. **Logical**: Aligns with user expectations about job lifecycle management

## 📝 **Updated Error Message**
```json
{
  "detail": "Cannot delete job that is currently processing. Please cancel the job first or wait for it to complete."
}
```

This provides clear guidance on how to handle the edge case while maintaining data safety.
