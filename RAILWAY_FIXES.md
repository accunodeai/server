🎯 RAILWAY CONFIGURATION FIXES
================================

✅ FIXED ISSUES:
1. ❌ Removed deprecated `restartPolicyType` and `restartPolicyMaxRetries` from railway.toml
2. ❌ Removed deprecated `[build]` section - Railway auto-detects Dockerfile
3. ❌ Deleted deprecated nixpacks.toml file  
4. ✅ Updated to current Railway configuration format

✅ CURRENT RAILWAY.TOML:
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
healthcheckPath = "/health"

[environments.production.variables]
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
DEBUG = "false"
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = "1"
PYTHONPATH = "/app"
API_V1_STR = "/api/v1"
PROJECT_NAME = "Default Rate API"
```

🚀 WHAT RAILWAY WILL DO AUTOMATICALLY:
- ✅ Auto-detect Python provider
- ✅ Auto-detect Dockerfile 
- ✅ Use Railpack (default builder)
- ✅ Build using your Dockerfile
- ✅ Apply environment variables
- ✅ Use the healthcheck path

🔧 RAILWAY DASHBOARD SETTINGS:
Based on your screenshots, you can also configure these in the UI:
- Builder: Railpack (Default) ✅
- Start Command: Already set in railway.toml ✅  
- Healthcheck Path: Already set to /health ✅
- Restart Policy: Set to "On Failure" in UI (10 retries max)
- Region: Southeast Asia (Singapore) ✅

⚡ NEXT STEPS:
1. Commit these fixes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway configuration - remove deprecated settings"
   git push

2. Deploy to Railway:
   ./deploy-railway.sh

3. The error should be gone now! 🎉

The main issue was using deprecated configuration fields that Railway no longer supports.
